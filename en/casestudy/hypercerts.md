# Hypercerts

**Overview**

Hypercerts is a blockchain-based protocol that provides a sustainable funding model for public goods projects. It transparently and reliably proves project outcomes and impacts, adopting a "retrospective funding" approach that allocates funds based on results.

**Year of Implementation**

Initial concept was released in 2022, with details announced in June of the same year.

**Operator**

Hypercerts Foundation

#### Operational Process

**Funding Model**

1. Project Initiation
   * Create project details (title, content, expected impact, etc.) as a Hypercert

2. Initial Fundraising
   * Funders purchase Hypercerts to provide initial funding to projects
   * Raise funds through small donations on platforms like Gitcoin

3. Project Implementation
   * Proceed with projects using raised funds

4. Outcome Evaluation
   * Independent evaluators assess project impact and record it on the blockchain

5. Retrospective Funding
   * Provide additional funding based on outcomes
   * Funders can trade Hypercerts

#### Results and Characteristics

**Success Stories**

* Achievements in Gitcoin grant rounds: Hypercerts used for fundraising and outcome verification, leading to multiple successful projects
* Network expansion through collaborations with "Funding the Commons" and "Sustainable Blockchain Summit"

**Keys to Success**

* Enhanced transparency: Using blockchain to record outcomes and prevent tampering
* Flexible funding: Can be integrated with traditional grant models and crowdfunding
* Outcome-focused fund allocation: Efficient resource utilization through funding based on actual results

**Challenges**

1. Technical Barriers
   * Need for education and outreach to those unfamiliar with blockchain and NFTs

2. Establishing Evaluation Systems
   * Need to develop evaluation criteria for long-term and indirect outcomes

3. Regulatory Compliance
   * Need to adapt to different regulations and tax systems across countries

#### Potential Applications in Japanese Society

**Expected Effects**

* Improved transparency and reliability: Gaining trust from supporters and the public by visualizing project outcomes and fund flows
* Outcome-oriented fund allocation: Promoting concentration of funds on effective social issue resolution
* Integration of diverse funding methods: Possible to combine traditional grants and crowdfunding with new models

**Implementation Challenges**

1. Need for Educational Activities
   * Essential to conduct awareness activities to spread the concept and benefits of Hypercerts to the social sector and general public

2. Building Evaluation Criteria
   * Need to establish appropriate criteria for evaluating project social impact

3. Integration with Existing Systems
   * Need strategies to coexist and integrate with current grant systems and NPO mechanisms
