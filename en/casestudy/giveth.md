#### Fund Distribution Model

**Adoption of Quadratic Funding**

Quadratic Funding (QF) is a fund distribution model that amplifies the impact of small donations. This model distributes matching funds based on the number of donors, ensuring that projects supported by more people receive more funding.

1. Mechanism
   * Calculate the sum of the square roots of each donor's contribution amount, then square that value to determine the matching amount
   * Provide larger matching funds to projects with more small donors

2. Effects
   * Engage a wide range of donors and promote fund distribution to diverse projects
   * Amplify the influence of small donors and support grassroots activities

**Donation Incentive Programs**

1. GIVbacks Program
   * Donors receive GIV tokens by donating to specific projects
   * Tokens can be used for staking or project evaluation

2. GIVpower
   * Earn GIVpower by staking GIV tokens
   * Used to boost projects and increase visibility

3. GURVES and GIVfi (Planned)
   * GURVES: Mechanism for building project-specific token economies
   * GIVfi: System to utilize unused donations and improve the sustainability of the entire ecosystem
