# Compound Grants Program 2.0 (CGP 2.0)

**Overview**

Compound is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol operating on Ethereum, providing a platform for cryptocurrency lending and borrowing. CGP 2.0, introduced in January 2023, is a grant program to promote the development of the Compound ecosystem, adopting a Delegated Domain Allocation (DDA) model. This model enables experts to handle fund allocation for each domain, improving transparency and efficiency while promoting community participation.

**Year of Implementation**

2023

**Operator**

* Compound Labs, Inc.
* Compound Finance Community

**Target Areas**

* New protocol ideas and dApps
* Security analysis tools and bounties
* Developer tools
* Multi-chain strategy

**Objectives**

* Promoting growth of the Compound ecosystem
* Achieving decentralized fund allocation
* Strengthening the builder community

**Results**

* Total funds: $1,000,000 (27,609.05 COMP)
* 35 proposals approved and $252,000 paid (approved $670,000 in grants over 2 quarters)
* Supporting diverse projects across 4 strategic domains, including projects supporting Compound's Optimism chain deployment

#### Fund Distribution Model

**DDA Model Mechanism**

1. Fund Management Structure
   * Total funds managed by a 3/5 multi-signature wallet (Grants SAFE), signed by the program manager and 4 domain allocators
   * Each domain managed separately by a 2/2 multi-signature wallet, signed by the program manager and domain allocator

2. Domain and Allocator Selection Process
   * Community voting determines 4 priority domains
   * Allocators apply based on community member recommendations and are selected after evaluation

3. Proposal Evaluation and Fund Allocation
   * Each domain allocator evaluates proposals and decides approval or rejection
   * Funds distributed milestone-based, with payments made while confirming progress

4. Ensuring Transparency
   * Fund flows and decision processes managed on-chain and published on dashboard
   * Quarterly performance evaluation of allocators

#### Results and Characteristics

**Success Stories**

* Compound 3 Wrapper project: Development of wrapper contracts improving Compound v3 usability
* Anthias.xyz project: Development of data analysis tools for Compound protocol

**Keys to Success**

* Utilizing expertise: Specialized experts handling fund allocation for each domain
* Efficient fund allocation: Allocators making independent decisions, enabling rapid proposal approval and fund distribution
* Promoting community participation: Community involvement in domain allocator selection and program evaluation
* Flexibility and adaptability: Quarterly evaluations allowing changes to domains and allocators as needed

**Challenges**

1. Appropriate Selection of Domain Allocators
   * Need to establish fair processes for selecting candidates with expertise and experience

2. Managing Conflicts of Interest
   * Appropriate management when allocators have interests in specific projects

3. Standardizing Evaluation Criteria
   * Setting consistent evaluation criteria across domains to ensure fairness

* Improved transparency: Visualizing fund flows and decision-making through on-chain management and public dashboard
* Promoting community participation: Expanding citizen participation through domain allocator selection and evaluation
* Efficient operation: Improving efficiency through rapid expert decision-making and milestone-based fund distribution

**Implementation Challenges**

1. Legal and Regulatory Compliance
   * Need to design models adapted to Japanese legal systems and regulatory environment

2. Establishing Evaluation Criteria
   * Setting consistent evaluation criteria to ensure fairness in fund allocation
