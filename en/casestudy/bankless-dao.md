#### Bounty System Details

**Overview**

The bounty system is a mechanism that assigns tasks within Bankless DAO to members and pays rewards based on their contributions. Using a dedicated web application "Bounty Board," it efficiently manages everything from task proposals to execution and reward payments.

**Operational Process**

1. Task Proposal and Approval
   * Guild or project leaders propose tasks, which are approved by the DAO community or relevant departments

2. Task Publication
   * Approved tasks are listed on the "Bounty Board" for members to choose from

3. Task Execution and Submission
   * Members select tasks and create deliverables in specified formats
   * After submission, reviewers conduct evaluations

4. Reward Payment
   * When tasks are approved, rewards (primarily BANK tokens) are paid

**Bounty Types and Rewards**

* Target Tasks:
  * Content creation (articles, videos, design)
  * Translation
  * Technical development (web applications, smart contracts)
  * Marketing and community management

* Reward Amounts:
  * Hundreds to thousands of BANK (1 BANK is the DAO's native token) depending on task difficulty and importance

**Utilization of Coordinape**

* Distributing 4.5M BANK each season through mutual evaluation among members
* Maintaining transparency in the evaluation process to achieve fair reward distribution

**Seasonal Goal Setting and Adjustment**

* Goals and bounties are set at the start of each season (16 weeks) and flexibly adjusted as needed
* Example: In Season 1, 5M BANK was allocated to guilds and projects, with 1M BANK used for Coordinape
