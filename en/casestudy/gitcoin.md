# Gitcoin

**Overview**

Gitcoin is a platform established to support open source software developers and strengthen collaboration within the developer community. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, it enables transparent and efficient fund distribution. Its core Quadratic Funding (QF) model emphasizes the impact of small donors and achieves fair fund distribution that reflects the opinions of the entire community.

#### Fund Distribution Model

**Quadratic Funding Mechanism**

1. Basic Principles
   * Quadratic Funding is a mechanism where both donation amount and number of donors influence fund distribution. Projects that collect many small donations are designed to receive more funds than those relying on large donations.

2. Calculation Method
   * Calculate the square root of each donor's contribution amount, sum them, and use the square of that sum as the matching amount.
   * Example:
     * Project A: 10 donors each contributing $10 → Evaluation amount approximately $1,000.
     * Project B: 1 donor contributing $100 → Evaluation amount remains $100.

3. Donation Process
   * Developers and project teams register on the Gitcoin platform and present detailed project information.
   * Supporters choose their preferred projects to donate to, with matching funds allocated based on donation amounts.

#### Operational Process

**1. Matching Pool Composition**

* Fund providers: Foundations, companies, individual donors, etc.
* Fund allocation: QF rounds are conducted quarterly, with the total pool amount distributed to projects.

**2. Project Registration and Review**

1. Project Application
   * Project teams submit applications detailing objectives, activities, and fund usage.

2. Review and Approval
   * Program managers or selection committees review applications and approve those meeting criteria.

**3. Donation Collection and Matching Calculation**

1. Donation Collection
   * Community members donate to projects, with small donations particularly emphasized.

2. Matching Calculation
   * Calculate matching amounts based on the square root of each donation amount and distribute to each project.

**4. Fund Allocation and Distribution**

1. Results Publication
   * Publish calculation results to ensure transparency.

2. Fund Distribution
   * Distribute funds in bulk from the matching pool to projects.
